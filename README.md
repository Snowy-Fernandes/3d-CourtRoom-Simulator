# 3D Courtroom Simulator

This project is a **3D Courtroom Simulator** game, designed to provide a realistic courtroom experience. It allows users to navigate a 3D courtroom environment, interact with various objects, and experience a simulated trial.

## Features

- **3D Environment**: Realistic 3D courtroom setting for immersive interaction.
- **Interactive Objects**: Ability to interact with objects like documents, the judge's bench, chairs, etc.
- **User Controls**: Navigate around the courtroom with intuitive keyboard and mouse controls.
- **Customizable Scene**: Modify the scene (e.g., add more objects or change the layout) for different trial scenarios.
- **Backend Integration**: Includes API integration to manage trial data, user interaction, and more.

## Requirements

Before running the simulator, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for backend)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing packages)
- **Three.js** (for rendering 3D objects)
- **Vite** (for fast development build)

Additionally, you will need a **WebGL-compatible browser** (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for the 3D scene to render.
